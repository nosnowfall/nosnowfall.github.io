Hi! I'm Elijah Berger, and this is my portfolio website. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UW-Madison, and I am a graduate researcher in the Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC). I am presently searching for a job (primarily in the Seattle area, where I am from) to start after I graduate in May 2026.

Before coming to UW-Madison, I worked in manufacturing and test at Prodrive Technologies, Inc. in Canton, Massachusetts. Even before that, I got my bachelor's in Physics at Bowdoin College. Keep reading for more on my background and motivations, or check out the tabs above for some examples of my work. A pdf copy of my CV is also up there, and professional references or other information are available upon request.

Some personal anecdotes
-----
Originally from Seattle, I have also lived in Boston, Madison, and for a short time in Hanoi. I love to cook, especially trying new recipes with my friends whenever we get together. Weather permitting, you can often find me playing ultimate frisbee in the park or racing small sailboats. I'm an avid bike commuter, rain or shine. I also designed my own deck of cards that contains several of my favorite games, but for fear of copyright infringement it is not for sale.

I'm pursuing power electronics because I believe in a cleaner and greener future, and because after three years in industry I enjoyed working on those products the most. As a graduate student in the WEMPEC lab, I've been working GaN-based RF inverters. I am primarily involved in the IARPA EQuAL-P project focusing on HF-band switch-mode amplifiers. It is a team effort, but my main contributions are in circuit and control design. That work bleeds into my secondary project, a capacitve power transfer system for heating resistive media such as salt water. Showcases from this work can be found in the research tab. Being a scientist at heart and with my background in physics, I am also interested in test instrument design - you can see some of my hobby projects on this site.
